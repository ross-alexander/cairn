# Diary of travelling in the land of Joiry

## Session 1

While travelling to the Spring Fair at Latour-Rose the party
discovered a stash of fine Murano glassware, perhaps abandoned due to
the recent troubles, and decided to cart it to the fair to sell.

Several days out of Latour-Rose as evening set the party were set upon
by a group of goblins and very large timber wolf.  Before the wolf,
filled with feral cunning beyond what is normal, could attack Willhelm
enscorcelled the creature.  I rushed forward and smote one of the
goblins with my scepter and the remaining fled.

I bribe the wolf with a ration of dried meat, for which it was
satisfied and disappeared into the darkness.

- Use ration for wolf

We travelled on into the darkness, spying what looked to be a giant on
a hill some distance away.  We hurried on towards a flickering fire in
the distance, finding the fire outside a small stony bothy by the
roadside.

![Bothy](bothy.jpg){width=90%}\

A group of half a dozen ne'er-do-wells were already occupying the
bothy, with a tarp set up to to give extra cover.  On a fire was a pot
with a rabbit stew.

Their leader, a slim man called Evander, invited us to join them.
They all looked like brigends except a young woman called Elene, a
servent to Andrea de Courte, a merchant from Latour-Rose.  I could not
determine if she was a captive or not, but we were outnumbered so
nobody wanted to push it.

- Small wiry fellow
- Woman with cudgel
- Large man with cudgel

Fortunately Luca and his dog turned up with a brace of conies, enough
meat for all our group with some to spare.  I broke out my jug of
honey wine and shared it around the whole group, reducing the
tension and quite possibly saving us from violence.

![Jug of wine](jug.jpg){width=90%}\

Both parties eventually settled down for the night, with each group
setting a watch.  Some time towards dawn the wolf made an appearance
but the remains of the stew were enough to keep it from devouring
anybody.  We left at sunrise and headed along road to the next town.

Reaching the town of Lac-de-fer in the early morning and purchase a
meal at an inn called the Leaping Fish.  I am incensed to hear a cult
known as the Tideborn has occupied and descrated the church in the
village.

- Spent 2sp for good breakfast

However mindful of the valuable cargo we were carrying and our few
numbers I held my wrath in check.  We were forced to sell one of the
glass goblets to the local bargeman for passage across the lake.

![Lac-de-fer](lac-de-fer.jpeg){width=90%}\ 

On the barge we were accopanied by The Three Players, a troupe of
entertainers named Yslen the Magnificent, Breagle the Strong and
Eloise.  As we crossed the waters a small fishing boat approached and
we were acosted by one Carlu the Corsair, a cruel-faced fellow with an
impressive moustache.  He claimed to be searching for a Lady Annwyn
and demanded to search and stab the womenfolk on the barge.

With swift action from Willhelm and Luca the corsair's bowmen were
robbed of the bows and with a mighty push by Luca the barge lurched
away from the boat, causing the corsairs to plunge into the water
rather than leap aboard.  Both the boat and the barge hastily rowed
and polled away, leaving them to flounder.


## Session 2

We enter the town of Latour-Rose and are greeted by local guard and
gardener named Antoine.  He recommended going to Monsieur Boutin, the
stall manager, who is at the center of the town.

- The Juggler's Zeal
- River running through the center of the town
- Castle falling down
- Baronial square has palace

Monsieur Boutin recommends two stall holders, M d'Salice and M
d'Courte, for selling the glassware to, otherwise we can hire a stall
in the main square, at the cost of 100sp per day and 1/20 of the sale
as taxes.  The alternative is to set up in the Pauper's square, which
costs nothing, apart from the tax.  However selling valuable items in
the pauper's square is to invite theft and there will be few buyers.

![Glassware](glassware.jpg){width=90%}\ 

Henri the guard clears a path to M d'Salice and M Boutin quietly
suggests not taking anything less than ten talens for glass.  After a
short discusion we depart, followed by an non descript character by
the name of Martin.

At M d'Courte he offers to sell it on our behalf, taking a fifth as
his cut.  We sell two pieces to him for a gold talen and 100 silver
pennies.  Afterward we return to d'Salice and sell the remaining items
for ten talens and 200 silver pennies, immediately splitting the money
so each receive two talens.  We are recommended the Hungry Cock by
Martin as a place to lodge for the night.

Spend the remainder of the day shopping, encountering
a number of strange people including Talak the
Thred Merchant and Lady Snika.

![Book](old-book.jpg){width=90%}\ 

- Spent 1 talents buying a new set of cloths
- Spent 1 talent on book and hourglass

I purchase a new set of travelling robes and boots, an hour glass and
a book containing local folk songs.

We return to the Hungry Cock and while supping out evening meal are
set upon by Martin and a crew of thugs.  Somehow Lady Snika gets
involved and steals a boot from right off Luca's foot.  After a short
fracas the thugs leave with the badly beaten Martin and the inn keeper
is forced to hand over 212 silver pennies for this part in the ambush.
We depart for fresh lodging.  In the proceedings Lady Snika and her
dog show they are not what they seem, but some sort of fey creatures.

## Session 3

>Monsieur Boutin, market-master, has a favour to ask of the heroes
>having helped them when they arrived in Latour-Rose.

>Merchants and other travelers have complained of raids on the northern
>road. The bandits seem to have made their camp in an old ruin, long
>crumbled.  The ruin is said to be haunted and perhaps cursed, and
>given the guard are largely volunteers it is proving hard to get
>anyone to investigate.

>The curious thing is the bandits appear more interested in taking
>captives than treasure, though they take that too.  So far no demand
>for ransom has been received nor prisoner released…

>Surely however the heroes, who are brave* and armed with faith, steel
>and magic, will prove up to this task.

Having spend some time in Latour-Rose the party have picked up some
followers and a mule.  We acknowledge the favour owned to Monsieur
Boutin and after collecting additional equipment and supplies from the
town vow to set forth as the fair is winding down.

- Maurice the Muleteer
- Didier the Didier
- Armand the Mendicant
- Rayée (mule)

![Mule](mule.jpg){width=90%}\ 

We head north from Latour-Rose and after a while meet The Three
Players, whom we had encountered previously near Lac de Fer.  Towards
the evening we reach the path, heading off to the left into pine
forest, but elect to continue on for another hour and make camp in an
existing clearing next to the road.

After an evening of song, dance and tricks all have a safe night and
leaving the group the party heads back south to the path.  After maybe
half an hour we encounter a group of peasants gathering snails and
mushrooms.  They say there is a group rebuilding the ruined temple
deeper in the forst and that they had started before the winter.  While
they group is not particularly large, and might hesitate attacking
a group of five there has been a giant feral cat stalking the
area for the last few months.

![Snails](snails.jpg){width=90%}\ 

We pay an old woman five silver pennies to show us way to the temple,
another three to four hours further into the forest.  After a while on
the path the mule refuses to budge so it is tied off in a thicket some
way of the path.

We continue on for a good hour before discovering some conceiled
leycap mushrooms, a little way off the path.  While gathering them the
cry of a wild cat is heard and it attempts to ambush the party.  With
swift action the cat is taken down with a couple of crossbow bolts and
as it lay wounded a cloud of darkness seeps out of its body.

I present the Holy Fingerbone and calling forth the power of our Lord
banish the evil back to the Pit.  The cat shrinks back to the size of
an ordinary feral animal and the party, rather than slay the beast or
leave it to die, patch it up with bandages and salves.

![Cat](cat.jpg){width=90%}\ 

We track through the forest for another couple of hours, staying near
but not on the path.  Nearing the temple I stash my cart a little off
the path and while doing so hear voices approaching along the path
towards us.

Carefully stealthing through the underbrush we spy two people in black
robes pushing a cart with a corpse loaded onto it.  In conversation
they say it will only be another few nights before the great work is
done.  We track the cultists to a stream where there a number of
bodies, possibly even half a dozen, dumped near the water.

An ambush and melee ensue and both cultists are rightfully slain.  The
corpse is that of a merchant who was in Latour-Rose for the faire, by
the name of Vincent Guerin.

Leaving the stream and grisly occupants we return back and
after an hour and a half reach a stone wall.  Beyond is
some sort of chapel or temple, and the sounds of a couple
talking.

Another melee ensues with one of the cultists, a woman of unknown
description, animating two corpses with foul necromancy.  I destroy
one with my vial of holy water and the other is eventually beaten
down.

Inside the temple there is a dark alter which is being restored
by blood sacrifice but it cracked by me striking it with my
lit censor.  The woman manages to escape using some sort of
darkness magic but leaves her book behind.

After it all over we capture two cultists, a woman with a burnt face
and a large burly man.  We rescue two teenages, who are the son and
daughter of Vincent Guerin.

By the alter are stairs going into a cellar and within is a chest and
a statue of of a toad god, which is destroyed.  Around the cellar are
strange runes carved into its walls and on reviewing the book it seams
the cultist leader was attempting to transcribe them.

The chest reveals nine gold talens, 466 silver pennies, a beautiful
inlaid wooden box worth perhaps 400sp, a box containing one and 1/3
Lightsucker candles and a pair of very familiar Moreno goblets worth
200sp.

![Box](box.jpg){width=90%}\ 

The book contains one and 3/4 spells, which Willhelm claims.  We
rescue another two people leave the temple, pushing hard to get
back to the road by night fall.  The following day we return
to Latour-Rose and hand over the captive cultists.  Later
we are feasted by the town and my spend items replaced by the
church.

# Session 4

After a short discussion it is decided Wilhelm should hold
the Lightsucker candle, as nobody else wanted to be associated
with such dark sorcery.  Due to its fragile nature it
needs to be kept in a sturdy box.

A few days after our return Father Jan asks if can escort
Brother Fabien to the Priory of Ste. Elodie de la Forest, which
is deep in the Forest du Tarascon, the same forest that
the fallen temple is.

It is pressed upon us the there is a path through the 
forest to the priory and that while poorly tended is
denizens of the forest will not harm those who travel
along it.

However there are bandits, and dispossessed men following the war,
that roam the forest however and Brother Fabien carries a valuable
hymnal so it is thought unwise for him to travel alone.

The church does not offer coin for this service but rather
will pay in gear, provisions and room and board.

Brother Fabien is a large and watchful man, and strikes me as a former
soldier who has witnessed too much war and horror for this soul to
take.  While morose and reserved the cudgel he carried spoke
of violence repressed.

The group, five men, a mule and my hand cart, set off north
along the road, laden with six days of travel rations.  The
path leading to the priory is not as far along as the path
to the temple and we camp on the road over night before
heading in.

After a couple of hours into the forest meet a group of 20 peasents
who are forging for mushrooms and other materials.  Luca offers some
rations and we stop and have a short second breakfast with the group.

Their leader warns us to always stay on the path, for it is a blessed
path, and provided we do not do violence to the forest the forest and
its creatures will not harm us.  However men are not bound by this and
they speak of a group of deserters further to the west (along the
path).

The peasents say this close to the road it is safe to stray off
the path but they do not travel further in, particular because
there are men further along.

![Gloomy forest](gloomy-forest.jpg){width=90%}\ 

We continue along, the path slowly closing in but wide enough for the
mule and cart, until we reach a fallen tree.  Luca is a fine woodsman
and his sharp axe makes good work, and between myself, Fabien and the
mule we clear the cut pieces off onto the sides.  I stack up some of
the wood onto the cart for later use.

After not more than half an hour Luca detects the smell of woodsmoke
from a recently doused fire.  I use the wood to create a small
barricade across the cart as a form of cover, should bowmen appear.

Luca steals forth and spies a camp set up on the path, with four
tents, with five men and a single women.  Two of the men
have bows, while the leader has an axe and the others have knives.

Returning, Luca formulates a plan for myself and Fabien to wander
towards the camp with the flagon on honey wine, singing and staggering
as if we had imbibed too much.

This occurs, and their leader, Martin the Bloody, demands we
surrender.  Feining surprise and fright we flee back to the
cart where Luca lies in wait.

Throwing away their advantage with having bows the instead
charge after us and are taken by complete surprise when hold
our ground strike with weapons.

We are hard pressed, with three verses five, but to my surprise
the women stabs one of the deserters in the back and when
he turns to remonstrate, stabs him again in the chest.  After
that we gain the advantage, but not before Luca and Fabien
take wounds.  Martin surrenders but before the woman, having
finished off two of her wounded compatriots, can go to
work on him Luca beheads him.

We gather up a couple of bows and arrows, but there is little else the
deserters have on them, or in their camp.  The women, Gaelle by name,
claims to be held against her will.  Luca seems skeptical but
considering she acted against them is given the benefit of the doubt.

![Bandits](bandits.png){width=90%}\ 

Towards the evening see torches off the path and we hear singing.  We
all stopper our ears and avoid looking at the lights.  Camping, we set
a watch with myself, Maurice and Armand, but are not disturbed.

Travelling on for next half a day its gets slow and boggy but we find
a stream so we wash the dirt and blood of the bandit encounter.

![Pack](wolves-pack.jpg){width=90%}\ 

At noon see a pack of six wolves lying across the path.  Luca
initially tries to shoo them away with a stick and I try with the
smoke of the censor but in the end it takes a large fire and plenty of
smoke to drive them away.  This takes a couple of hours and its starts
to rain.  We push on and are forced to wade waist deep through a
puddle blocking the path.  This takes quite some time and it getting
dark as we start moving again.

After setting camp a voice calls out to us, and a satyr named Ilikon
offers us sustenance.  After ensuring no fey trickery we welcome him
and are plied with a fine rich wine, heady and strong.

A friendly competition ensues and with my lead and Fabien's rich
baritone accompaniment the satyr is bested and in return we are taught
a Song of the Forest.

![Satyr](satyr.jpg){width=90%}\

Afterward more fey arrive and revelry ensues, with Gaelle dancing
wildly with Ilikon.  Ilikon tries to get Gaelle to join them, and
after much discourgement from Luca and myself, choses to go for a year
and a day, and only with Ilikon, with the promise of a gossimer dress,
meeting the elf king and riding of the back of a bumble bee.

In return we are given the flagon of wine and warned that path goes
near the elf kingdom, who are beautiful but fell.  In the morning all
wounds are healed and wake up refreshed but with a hangover.

![Elves](sithi.jpeg){width=90%}\

Off the path are three tall slender figures with cat's eyes, silver
hair and armed with swords and bows.  The are elves of the forest,
their leader called Eloriel.

We are invited to the Elf Court, but we all politely decline,
although I offer to come after our task is done, for I quest
for song and tales, and I'm intriged by their statement that
there are places mortals can go that they cannot.

The generously give a parcel of six honeycakes each of which can keep
a man fed for a day, and an Elfwhistle which may be blown once for aid
and then must be returned (if blown again it will still call something
forth) and three Trueflight arrows (d12, 50% chance of being
retreived).  I offer to quest a trifle for them and they give me fine
wooden box in which you are to capture the laughter of a child, which
will not rob the child of voice or future merriment.

Its rains heavily through out the day so slow going but we are not
attacked and towards the end of day see a palisade and a group of
monks attending the area inside.

We are taken to Friar Thomas and both Fabien and the hymnal are safely
delivered.  After Evensong an early night is welcome with a warm cot
in a dry room.
